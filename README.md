PROJECT OVERVIEW 

1. Challenge Outline (academic standard: passlevel detail: section required for pass) – 10%
   a. Summary and review of the problem, overall proposed solution.
   b. UML style diagram illustrating initial overall solution (linked to 1a)
   c. Initial working plan, overall approach, developmentstrategy and approach to quality (linked to 1a,
   1b).
   d. Analysis and decomposition of the overall problem into key ‘epic’ style tasks (linked to 1b, 1c).
   e. Initial object-oriented design ideas and planned phased breakdown into smaller tasks(linked to 1d).


2. Development (academic standard: merit level detail: section required for merit) – 15%
   a. Adoption and use of ‘good’ standards(linked to 1a, 1b, 1c).
   b. Phase 1 development: tasks, code review and changes(linked to 1d,1e).
   c. ..repeated for each development phase.
   d. Phase n development: tasks, code review and changes(linked to 1d,1e).
   e. Ensuring quality through testing and resolving bugs(linked to 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b..2c).
   f. Reflection on key design challenges, innovations and how they were solved (with examples).


3. Evaluation (academic standard: distinction level detail: section required for distinction) – 10%
   a. Analysis with embedded examples of key code refactoring, reuse, smells.
   b. Implementation and effective use of ‘advanced’ programming principles(with examples).
   c. Features showcase and embedded innovations(with examples) - opportunity to ‘highlight’ best bits.
   d. Improved algorithms – research, design, implementation, and tested confirmation (with examples).
   e. Reflective review, opportunities to improve and continued professional development.
